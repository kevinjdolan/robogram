Robogram is centered around a simple robot named Marvin. Marvin has two wheels and a few sensors to learn about his environment. Robogrammers write sets of instructions called robograms on a computer or tablet, which are beamed to Marvin over bluetooth. Robograms consist of sets of visually connected blocks containing instructions like "move forward" or "turn right," which allow simple real-time analysis of running robograms. Robogrammers learn the fundaments of programming by advancing through a series of challenges involving Marvin and included accessories.

Marvin can be expanded with alternative shells, including a robotic claw, ultrasonic radar and even a fully customizable breadboard for advanced electronics experimentation. Marvin knows which shell is attached, so it's easier to write robograms for different configurations. There are different sets of challenges focusing on different sets of skills for each shell.

Robogram's primary strength lies in its simplicity. Marvin just works out-of-the-box. It isolates the fundamentals by eliminating complicated syntax and electronics debugging. Writing your first robogram takes seconds and the challenges are designed to build skills gradually, while allowing wiggle room for free-form exploration.

It's not just for kids. At its core, Robogram can be controlled using a simple bluetooth protocol wrapped inside several open-source APIs. This means that it's an excellent robot platform for hobbyists interested in building anything that needs to move!

These open-source APIs also mean that when the time comes to advance beyond the basics, robogrammers can learn to program using industry-standard programming languages like Python or Java. With the proper foundation, translating these skills to other environments is a breeze.
